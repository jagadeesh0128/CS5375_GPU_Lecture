## CPU Code Execution
1. Initial step is to conenct HPCC using e-raider credentials
2. clone the project **git clone https://github.com/jagadeesh0128/CS5375_GPU_Lecture.git**
3. once clone the project then will have enter to the file **CS5375_GPU_Lecture**.
4. ls
5. g++ martix_Mul_cpu.cpp -o matrixMul_cpu.exe
6. ./matrixMul_cpu.exe
7. time ./matrixMul_cpu.exe
8. All the results are saved in .txt format for your reference.

## PART1

the below are the commands to exectute the requirements of Part1.
1. Interactive -p gpu-build
2. nvcc matrixMul_gpu -o matrixMul_gpu.exe
3. ./matrixMul_gpu

Include comments and analysis, etc.
